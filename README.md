# Stateful Model Simulator

This repository contains code that simulates model error due to out of order data points.

## Repository Overview

* **stateful\_simulator:** a python package that simulates model error
* **experiments:** a directory of experiments run using the stateful\_simulator
* **stator:** a failed initial attempt at simulating ouf of order error using the very excellent [faust](https://faust.readthedocs.io)

## To Be Done
* Extend to classification models
* Speed up performance
* Implemnt more complex aggregations
* Implement statful models like ARIMA
* tests.... maybe?
* Way more...
